Free code camp project: Book trading club

This web application was build as part of Free code camp.
The requirements and an example of what the app should look like can
be found <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/manage-a-book-trading-club">here</a>.
The example app was very limited in functionality, notably not giving the users any way of
contacting each other. I did not try to improve on it in this project so the same can be
said for this website. I got a bit lazy at the end so thereÂ¨s practically no styling.


The app uses React, Node.js, MongoDB, Passport.js with twitter for authentication and Google books API
